# Smart City Parking System Project

## Project Overview
The Smart City Parking System Project aims to develop a prototype for an efficient and effective parking management system for smart cities. The system uses video analysis, data analytics, and real-time communication technologies to dynamically monitor and manage parking lot occupancy.

## Design Pattern: Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern is employed in this project to ensure that changes in parking spot occupancy are automatically communicated to other components, such as the user interface and notification system. This pattern involves two main components:
- **Subject**: Represents the parking lot's status.
- **Observers**: Components that need to be notified of changes in the parking lot's status.

## System Architecture
1. **Video Analysis and Data Collection**: A video feed is used to detect whether parking spots are occupied or free. The status data is sent to a central server.
2. **Data Processing**: The central server processes data from the video feed to determine the real-time status of each parking spot.
3. **Real-Time Notification**: The Observer pattern ensures that changes in parking spot status are immediately reflected in the user interface.
4. **User Interface**: A web interface displays the real-time status of parking spots, with available spots shown in green and occupied spots in red.

## Prototype Implementation
This project currently exists as a prototype. Key features include:
- **Video Simulation**: A video is used to simulate the parking lot environment, analyzing the occupancy status of parking spots.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system updates the status of parking spots in real-time and reflects these changes in the web interface.
- **User Interface**: A web page displays the current status of parking spots, using color coding to indicate availability.

## Future Work
- **Sensor Integration**: Incorporate physical sensors into the system for more accurate data collection.
- **Scalability**: Improve the system to handle larger parking lots and multiple locations.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement advanced data analytics for better prediction and management of parking spot availability.
